<h2 id="how-to-read-a-medieval-book-recomposing-bodley-851">How to Read a Medieval Book: Recomposing Bodley 851</h2>

<p><em>How to Read a Medieval Book</em> argues that miscellaneous manuscripts should be understood as literary artifacts.  Scholars frequently excerpt medieval texts from their manuscript contexts in order to analyze them individually; and book historians routinely uncover impressive data about authorships, readerships, and literary expectations from a close examination of all manuscripts containing a given text. My dissertation examines one exemplary manuscript, Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Bodley 851, in order to consider the medieval book itself in literary terms. This English miscellany contains over twenty texts, largely of unknown origin and primarily in Latin, written in at least eight different scribal hands, mostly transcribed in the second half of the fourteenth century and finally rubricated, decorated, and compiled early in the fifteenth century. Two of the texts present in Bodley 851 survive uniquely in this manuscript and are widely known to medieval scholars: the much-contested Z-text of <em>Piers Plowman</em> and the full text of Walter Map’s <em>De nugis curialium</em> (“On courtiers’ trifles”). Yet these two texts have never been read in conversation with one another, nor is either text commonly read in conversation with the popular Anglo-Latin poems compiled in the same miscellany, such as the <em>De coniuge non ducenda</em> (“On the necessity of avoiding marriage”) or the <em>Apocalypsis goliae episcopi</em> (“The revelation of the bishop Golias”). While many of the Latin texts preserved in Bodley 851 enjoyed significant popularity throughout the late-medieval period in England – the <em>De coniuge</em> and the <em>Apocalypsis</em> each survive in over fifty-five manuscript witnesses – most such “miscellaneous” texts are rarely discussed in any depth in contemporary scholarship. As the genres preserved within Bodley 851 range among Marian devotion, anti-marital satire, anti-ecclesiastic comedy, and military paean, so in my reading the breadth of manuscript compilation informs new perspectives on a wide array of topics frequently isolated from one another in contemporary scholarship.</p>

<h2 id="codicological-categories-in-england">Codicological Categories in England</h2>

<p><em>Codicological Categories</em> considers networks of textual affiliation in late-medieval miscellaneous manuscripts in England, which continue to be produced in large numbers well after the introduction of the printing press. Through an examination of how medieval scribes and readers arranged their texts in relation to one another differently over time, I ask how medieval practices of compilation, considered in the aggregate, calcified in the formation of modern genres. As with my first project, which reads Latin and Middle English, this project is multilingual, further taking into account French and Italian materials. I make use of reliable digital tools and query freely-available metadata for individual repositories to consider textual transmission at scale.</p>

<h2 id="insatiability-experience-and-embodiment-reading-the-codicological-unconscious-at-the-fragmentary-center-of-bodley-851">Insatiability, Experience, and Embodiment: Reading the Codicological Unconscious at the Fragmentary Center of Bodley 851</h2>

<p>Modern scholars, imagining the range of experience infamously evoked by Jankyn’s “book of wicked wives,” usually interpret medieval misogamous writing through a patristic and clerkly tradition dominated by Jerome. But surviving compilations rarely display the thematic unity of Jankyn’s anthology or neatly reproduce familiar formulations of the Hieronymian tradition. Rather, in their juxtapositions of unlike texts, these manuscripts provide material indications of how medieval misogamy might have been conceived differently, even if only for a moment, by the scribes who prepared such miscellanies and the readers who encountered them. In order to examine the cultural, imaginative, and ideological assumptions of material and textual composition in mixed-content manuscripts, this essay attends to the “codicological unconscious” of the manuscript I know best – Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Bodley 851. Specifically, I examine the obsession with feminine insatiability shared by two wholly unlike poems that survive exclusively and contiguously in a single scribal hand in the earliest material fragment of Bodley 851. Where the <em>Ave virgo mater christi</em> (“Hail Virgin Mother of Christ”) imagines insatiability as a laudable aspect of the Virgin Mary’s pure erotic relationship with God, the <em>De coniuge non ducenda</em> (“On the Necessity of Avoiding Marriage”) imagines insatiability as a despicable aspect of the wife’s proclivity for sexual transgression. Although this topical conjunction does not generate any overarching conceptual synthesis or competing misogamous ideology, it nevertheless illuminates how the experience of reading could generate glimpses of a world perceived otherwise than in terms of those historical prejudices which dominate our view.</p>

<h2 id="reading-too-much-forgetting-more-the-apocalypsis-goliae-episcopi-in-print-and-translation">Reading Too Much, Forgetting More: The <em>Apocalypsis goliae episcopi</em> in Print and Translation</h2>

<p>When John Bale, in his famous index, attributed the <em>Apocalypsis</em> to Walter Map, he adopted a position that had been available in manuscript hands for at least one-hundred years. Under his direction, this Anglo-Latin anti-ecclesiastic satire of the twelfth century was first printed in 1546, and at least partly after Bale’s influence, it would be printed and reprinted dozens of times in dozens of collections in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, by Protestants and Catholics alike. In some cases, individual owners provided their own annotations and translations, many of which signal unease about rapid technological changes alongside concern about corruption in the church. This essay tracks the afterlives and material  of a poem about the material afterlives</p>

<h2 id="goliardic-networks">Goliardic Networks</h2>

<p>Twice in recorded history the goliards have reached something like popular stardom: in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as protected or anonymous ecclesiastics launching endless social critiques in maddeningly punny verse; and in the first half of the twentieth century, as bibulous, love-making, springtime vagabonds dedicated to wine, women, and song. And a few codicological units, as in the Carmina Burana, the Cambridge Songs, or the latter sections of Harley 978 bear such associations out. The vast majority of manuscripts containing “goliardic” verse, however, are not dedicated to satire or song, women, wine, or whimsy. True miscellanies, such manuscripts mix Latin poetic material with patristic sermons, classical authorities, scholastic inquiries, visions, saints’ lives, and myth. This essay interprets metadata from the British Library as a network of texts and books, beginning with those items most commonly associated with the goliards in medieval and modern discourse, and uses standard methods for measuring likeness and influence to re-assess the effectiveness of the “goliardic” tag according to patterns of manuscript transmission.</p>

<h2 id="poetics-of-purgation-in-seamus-heaneys-station-island-sequence">Poetics of Purgation in Seamus Heaney’s ‘Station Island’ Sequence</h2>

<p>With near uniformity, critics read Seamus Heaney’s ‘Station Island’ sequence as an announcement of the poet’s liberation from political, religious, and personal troubles. Accounts of ‘Station Island’ often understand the authoritative voice of James Joyce, ventriloquized in the sequence’s final section, to provide a primary solution to difficult problems of cultural representation raised by Station Island and so to inform a major shift in Heaney’s œuvre. This essay argues that such criticisms overlook the nuanced work Heaney accomplishes in poetic dialogue with the sequence’s purgatorial setting on Lough Derg, the imagined shades who haunt Heaney’s penitential pilgrimage, and the literary influences that guide his craft. ‘Station Island’ does not advocate aesthetic liberation for the poet from his ghosts, nor does it signal a break in ethical commitment or aesthetic practice. Particularly in sections VIII and IX, ‘Station Island’ purges any poetic stance, such as that advocated by Joyce’s ghost, which would take the severing of social and religious ties as necessary grounds for poetic fashioning. Rather visionary than revisionary, the sequence acts as an enduring juridical and confessional ars poetica, in which poetry is not for the poet but for the communities he inhabits, their living and their dead.</p>
