I’m Tom Sawyer, a writing specialist at The University of Chicago. I earned my Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature at Washington University in St. Louis in 2021.

As an instructor of writing, I am committed to developing innovative, equitable approaches to the teaching of writing across the curriculum in reader-centered and process-centered modes. I aim to prepare students to communicate effectively to a broad array of audiences while expressing themselves confidently in their own voices.

As a scholar of the Middle Ages and literary comparatist, my research focuses on medieval miscellany manuscripts and their textual arrangements. I primarily deal with Anglo-Latin and Middle English poetry of the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. When I’m feeling adventurous, I sometimes dabble in the fifteenth, sixteenth, or -- on days propitious for ambition -- seventeenth centuries as well!

My dissertation discussed Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Bodley 851, a positively zany composite textual object that lets me talk about two infamous, uproarious, inscrutable texts at the same time -- Walter Map's _De nugis curialium_ and William Langland's _Piers Plowman_ (in its infamous "Z-text" redaction). This research forms the foundation for my first book project, _How to Read a Medieval Book: Recomposing Bodley 851_.

I have also begun to expand my miscellaneous repertoire after a systematic fashion, in a data-driven project provisionally titled _Codicological Categories in Medieval England._ There, I ask how practices of material and textual compilation, considered in the aggregate, calcified in the formation of modern genres. I am especially interested in the perspective we gain from those oft-copied (by medieval scribes) and little-read (by modern scholars) poems often inefficiently termed "goliardic," and how they function as members of a broad and complex manuscript network.

Thank you for stopping by this website of mine. As improvements are necessary, improvements will be made. Until then, know that it's comforting, to me, to know I exist -- and now you know too! The world is full of wonders.
