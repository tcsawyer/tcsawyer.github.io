I’m Tom Sawyer, and I recently defended my Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature at Washington University in St. Louis. My dissertation is titled, _How to Read A Medieval Book: Recomposing Bodley 851_. I study medieval English miscellany manuscripts and their textual arrangements, with focus on Anglo-Latin and Middle English poetry of the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. When I’m feeling adventurous, I sometimes dabble in the fifteenth, sixteenth, or -- on days propitious for ambition -- seventeenth centuries as well!

My current research continues to focus on Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Bodley 851, a positively zany composite textual object that lets me talk about two infamous, uproarious, inscrutable texts at the same time -- Walter Map's _De nugis curialium_ and William Langland's _Piers Plowman_ (in its infamous "Z-text" redaction). As I work to transform my dissertation into a monograph, I will further account for the presence of the _Speculum stultorum_ in the same manuscript, as representative of a satirical Anglo-Latin tradition.

I have also begun to expand my miscellaneous repertoire after a systematic fashion, in a data-driven project provisionally titled _Codicological Categories in England._ There, I ask how practices of material and textual compilation, considered in the aggregate, calcified in the formation of modern genres. I am especially interested in the perspective we gain from those oft-copied (by medieval scribes) and little-read (by modern scholars) poems often inefficiently termed "goliardic," and particularly how they function as members of a broad manuscript network.

For the time being, I have begun to learn from my friends and colleagues in DH how to “build a professional website” – so thank you for visiting this work in progress. (May all work ever be "in progress"!) As improvements are necessary, improvements may be made: until then, thanks for stopping by. It's comforting, to me, to know I exist, and now you know too!
