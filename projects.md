## How to Read a Medieval Book: Recomposing Bodley 851

_How to Read a Medieval Book_ proposes a generalizable method, from a book-historical perspective, for examining mixed-content manuscripts in order to discover, from a literary critical perspective, comparative readings of the texts those manuscripts contain. I argue that evidence from the material production of mixed-content manuscripts by medieval agents can serve as a blueprint for designating textual groups, as a map for determining effective critical approaches to those groups, and as a guide to defamiliarizing modern perceptions of medieval texts. I theorize the “codicological unconscious” – roughly, the range of unstated and obscured meanings that might emerge from close examination of a book and its texts in conversation – in order to describe how mixed-content manuscripts might once have signified for historical agents with expectations and delights strikingly unlike those of later readers.

The project examines one exemplary manuscript, Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Bodley 851, in order to consider the medieval book itself in literary terms. This English miscellany contains over twenty texts, largely of unknown origin and primarily in Latin, written in at least eight different scribal hands, mostly transcribed and decorated in the second half of the fourteenth century and finally compiled and bound by the middle of the fifteenth century. As the genres preserved within Bodley 851 range among Marian devotion, anti-marital satire, anti-ecclesiastic comedy, and military paean, so in my reading the breadth of manuscript compilation informs new perspectives on a wide array of topics frequently isolated from one another in contemporary scholarship.

## Codicological Categories in England

_Codicological Categories_ considers networks of textual affiliation in late-medieval miscellaneous manuscripts in England, which continued to be produced in large numbers well after the introduction of the printing press. Through an examination of how medieval scribes and readers arranged their texts in relation to one another differently over time, I ask how medieval practices of material and textual compilation, considered in the aggregate, calcified in the formation of modern genres. As with my first project, which reads Latin and Middle English, this project is multilingual, further taking into account French, German, and Italian materials. I harness developments in the digital humanities and make use of freely-available metadata for individual repositories to consider textual transmission at scale. Ultimately, alongside the publication of traditional scholarship, I envision the development of an interactive web application that would allow scholars to observe manuscript affiliation (e.g., by text, author, provenance, repository, and use over time) from a variety of perspectives (e.g. as network, tabulation, or graph), as far as available data and metadata permit.

## Insatiability, Experience, and Embodiment: Reading the Codicological Unconscious at the Fragmentary Center of Bodley 851

Modern scholars, imagining the range of experience infamously evoked by Jankyn’s “book of wicked wives,” usually interpret medieval misogamous writing through a patristic and clerkly tradition dominated by Jerome. But surviving compilations rarely display the thematic unity of Jankyn’s anthology or neatly reproduce familiar formulations of the Hieronymian tradition. Rather, in their juxtapositions of unlike texts, these manuscripts provide material indications of how medieval misogamy might have been conceived differently, even if only for a moment, by the scribes who prepared such miscellanies and the readers who encountered them. In order to examine the cultural, imaginative, and ideological assumptions of material and textual composition in mixed-content manuscripts, this essay attends to the “codicological unconscious” of the manuscript I know best -- Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Bodley 851. Specifically, I examine the obsession with feminine insatiability shared by two wholly unlike poems that survive exclusively and contiguously in a single scribal hand in the earliest material fragment of Bodley 851. Where the _Ave virgo mater christi_ (“Hail Virgin Mother of Christ”) imagines insatiability as a laudable aspect of the Virgin Mary’s pure erotic relationship with God, the _De coniuge non ducenda_ (“On the Necessity of Avoiding Marriage”) imagines insatiability as a despicable aspect of the wife’s proclivity for sexual transgression. Although this topical conjunction does not generate any overarching conceptual synthesis or competing misogamous ideology, it nevertheless illuminates how the experience of reading could generate glimpses of a world perceived otherwise than in terms of those historical prejudices which dominate our view.

## Reading Too Much, Forgetting More: The _Apocalypsis goliae episcopi_ in Print and Translation

When John Bale, in his famous index, attributed the _Apocalypsis_ to Walter Map, he adopted a position that had been available in manuscript hands for at least one-hundred years. Under his direction, this Anglo-Latin anti-ecclesiastic satire of the twelfth century was first printed in 1546, and at least partly after Bale's influence, it would be printed and reprinted dozens of times in dozens of collections in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, by Protestants and Catholics alike. In some cases, individual owners provided their own annotations and translations, many of which signal unease about rapid technological changes alongside concern about corruption in the church. This essay tracks the afterlives and material  of a poem about the material afterlives

## Goliardic Networks

Twice in recorded history the goliards have reached something like popular stardom: in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as protected or anonymous ecclesiastics launching endless social critiques in maddeningly punny verse; and in the first half of the twentieth century, as bibulous, love-making, springtime vagabonds dedicated to wine, women, and song. And a few codicological units, as in the Carmina Burana, the Cambridge Songs, or the latter sections of Harley 978 bear such associations out. The vast majority of manuscripts containing "goliardic" verse, however, are not dedicated to satire or song, women, wine, or whimsy. True miscellanies, such manuscripts mix Latin poetic material with patristic sermons, classical authorities, scholastic inquiries, visions, saints' lives, and myth. This essay interprets metadata from the British Library as a network of texts and books, beginning with those items most commonly associated with the goliards in medieval and modern discourse, and uses standard methods for measuring likeness and influence to re-assess the effectiveness of the "goliardic" tag according to patterns of manuscript transmission.

## Poetics of Purgation in Seamus Heaney’s ‘Station Island’ Sequence

Seamus Heaney’s “Station Island” sequence records the poet’s experience of a three-day penitential pilgrimage to the shrine at Lough Derg, long associated in literature with Purgatory. Caught between private confession and public examination, through “Station Island” Heaney confronts the inheritances and insufficiencies of his own poetic fashioning in dialogue with a series of imagined ghostly interlocutors. In its setting and in its contents, the sequence occupies a place of intersection between this world and the next, where the living meet the dead. Critical accounts often understand the authoritative voice of James Joyce, the ghostly speaker ventriloquized by Heaney in the final section of the sequence, to provide a primary solution to difficult problems of cultural representation raised by Station Island and so to inform a major shift in Heaney’s œuvre. In contrast, this essay argues that “Station Island” develops a poetic ideal which recognizes and incorporates the ethical accusations Heaney’s ghosts level at him without accepting any final imperative to aesthetic detachment or liberation from the world’s traumas in poetic fashioning. Particularly in sections 8 and 9, “Station Island” purges any poetic stance that would take the severing of social and religious ties as necessary grounds for poetic fashioning. Rather visionary than revisionary, the sequence acts as an enduring juridical and confessional ars poetica, in which poetry is not for the poet but for the communities he inhabits, their living and their dead.
