## Writing Specialist: _Human Being and Citizen I_ (Autumn 2021)

Overview for students:

Your Writing Seminars are affiliated with your Humanities Core Sequence, and they are structured to help you succeed as a writer in your core courses. These seminars also constitute their own course, however, which is pass/fail and necessary to graduate. Throughout the quarter, we will use your written work for _Human Being and Citizen_ as a point of departure for thinking through best practices in argumentative writing. While I have set topics for discussion corresponding to each week, it is best to think of these topics as provocative, rather than delimiting: it is most important to me that you become a better writer. The tools and approaches I prepare are means toward that end.

Main course blurb:

The autumn quarter explores the ways that Ancient Greek \[sic\] and the Abrahamic text of Genesis conceive of, express ideals about, and articulate tensions in conceptions and practices of justice, human and divine law, and emotion. We examine the ways these conceptions figure in literary, philosophical and religious texts concerned with rupture and continuity in the social order. We consider the ways human beings come together in groups (families, cities, armies, but also beliefs and aspirations) and strive to understand what binds these groups as structures of meaning-making and social practice. Texts include Homer's Iliad, the book of Genesis, Plato's Apology and Laches, and Sophocles' Antigone.

## _Imagining the Medieval in Modern Fantasy and Science Fiction_ (Fall 2020)

From the sensationalized violence of _Game of Thrones_ to Luke Skywalker’s monastic planet in _The Last Jedi_, in advertisements for light beer (dilly dilly!) and in the fairytale castle that appears before every Disney movie – the contemporary imagination is suffused with fictional representations of the European Middle Ages. In fantasy and science fiction writing in particular, postapocalyptic futures and magical parallel universes are indebted frequently to a mythologized version of the medieval past. We recognize “the medieval” intuitively by its shining knights, dour monks, clever witches, and grimy peasants. But what do these fictions have to do, if anything, with the way the medieval world thought about itself? And why do so many modern thinkers turn to an unfamiliar past in order to question the urgent political, social, religious, and ecological concerns of the present? What, in short, does the medieval have to do with the fantastic, the unnatural, or the strange?

## _Early Texts and Contexts_ (Fall 2018)

How did what we now call English literature emerge? How did literary activity shape the world, and how did the world shape writing? How can literature help us understand the history of art, race, religious identity and sectarian conflict, nations and empires, gender, sexuality, and class? We will address these questions by studying the early history of literature in English, from the Middle Ages through the late eighteenth century, as well as the tools, vocabularies, and critical practices of contemporary literary studies. We will learn about both the material forms of English literature (manuscript, print, and performance traditions) and major poetry and prose forms (sonnet, epic, blank verse, romance, letter, slave narrative, and more). In addition to Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and Ignatius Sancho or Olaudah Equiano, the syllabus may include authors and texts such as "Beowulf," "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," Julian of Norwich, Edmund Spenser, Margaret Cavendish, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, and Eliza Haywood. NOTE: Satisfies one of the two 200-level requirements for the English Major.
