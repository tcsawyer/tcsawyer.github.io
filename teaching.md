## *Imagining the Medieval in Modern Fantasy and Science Fiction*

From the sensationalized violence of *Game of Thrones* to Luke Skywalker’s monastic planet in *The Last Jedi*, in advertisements for light beer (dilly dilly!) and in the fairytale castle that appears before every Disney movie – the contemporary imagination is suffused with fictional representations of the European Middle Ages. In fantasy and science fiction writing in particular, postapocalyptic futures and magical parallel universes are indebted frequently to a mythologized version of the medieval past. We recognize “the medieval” intuitively by its shining knights, dour monks, clever witches, and grimy peasants. But what do these fictions have to do, if anything, with the way the medieval world thought about itself? And why do so many modern thinkers turn to an unfamiliar past in order to question the urgent political, social, religious, and ecological concerns of the present? What, in short, does the medieval have to do with the fantastic, the unnatural, or the strange?

Walter M. Miller Jr., A *Canticle for Leibowitz* (1959), Ursula K. Le Guin, *A Wizard of Earthsea* (1968), Terry Pratchett, *Equal Rites* (1987), N.K. Jemisin, *The Fifth Season* (2015)

Excerpts from medieval texts at my discretion.
